# Challenge Calculator

A command line calculator that supports add operations. Requires Python 3.

## How to use

Run with Python & provide an input string. Example:

```bash
$ python3 app.py 1,2
```

Output:
```bash
3
```

## String format

Supports max of 2 input integers, comma delimited, negative numbers are valid. Invalid, empty, or missing numbers default to `0`.


## Tests

Run tests with:

```bash
$ python3 test.py
```

There might be debug output that looks like errors. That's the testing of error conditions. As long as it says "OK" at the end of the test run, it's good.
